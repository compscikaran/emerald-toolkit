# React Dynamics

## How the idea came about

The idea is kind of is inspired by a monitoring tool called AppDynamics which is used for monitoring Java applications, the tool captures metrics such as errors, mounts, mouse clicks etc which could be helpful for diagnosing errors and inform product decisions. The tool is lightweight and will not have much impact on application performance.

## What is ReactDynamics

Key Features -
1. Built around components so granularity at which data is captured is fully controlled. It can be configured at page level, sections or even individual fields
2. Stores telemetry in the browser itself hence backend calls are not required for each and every event being captured in the system
3. Captures lifecycle events such as mounting, unmounting which can be used for performance analysis
4. Captures error stacktraces using Error Boundary which can be used for debugging
